## Documentation

Ruby libraries intended to be distributed or packaged as Gem MUST be documented using [YARD][1].

YARD is a powerful Ruby documentation tool for generating API documentation from Ruby source code. While the base syntax is compatible with RDoc, YARD provides a set of [Javadoc-inspired tags][4] the developer can use to enrich the documentation with details that cannot be extracted from the source code.

Compared to RDoc, YARD is able to generate a more detailed API documentation. It also offers some very handy tools, such as `yard server --reload`, that generates and reloads the documentation on-the-fly.
