# Editor Conventions


## Indentation

Indentation MUST consist of 2 spaces. Tabs are not allowed.

Configure your editor to use Soft Tabs (replace tabs with spaces) or Spaces.
The most part of IDE and editors support this feature.


## Maximum Line Length

The target line length SHOULD be 80 characters.

Developers SHOULD strive keep each line of their code under 80 characters where possible and practical. However, longer lines are acceptable in some circumstances.


## Line Termination

Line termination follows the Unix text file convention. Lines MUST end with a single linefeed (LF) character. Linefeed characters are represented as ordinal 10, or hexadecimal 0x0A.

Note: Do not use carriage returns (CR) as is the convention in Apple OS's (0x0D) or the carriage return - linefeed combination (CRLF) as is standard for the Windows OS (0x0D, 0x0A).


## Whitespaces
