title: the Rubyist
---

***The* Rubyist** is a growing collection of conventions and standards for Ruby programmers. It provides guidance to non-expert Ruby programmers on how to avoid common mistakes in their everyday work and also offers advice on what would be generally considered as bad practice.

This project was born from a real world need to document the common practices and coding conventions my team and [I](http://www.simonecarletti.com/) have been following during our daily work.
