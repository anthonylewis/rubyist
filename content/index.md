title: the Rubyist
---

***The* Rubyist** is a growing collection of conventions and standards for Ruby programmers. It gives advices to avoid common mistakes and bad practices that non-expert Ruby programmers may encounter on their daily work.

This project was born from a real world need to document the common practices and coding conventions my team and [I](http://www.simonecarletti.com/) have been following during our daily work.
