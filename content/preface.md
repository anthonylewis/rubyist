# Preface

## Disclaimer

The Rubyist does **not** aim to teach you programming in Ruby. Also, it does **not** pretend to represent *the* right answer to all the Ruby conventions. Many of the conventions contained in this documentation are largely opinionable and are merely the result of years of Ruby programming and hundreds of lines of code.

In fact, the entire project is opinionable. But when you work in team you have to define conventions and, good or bad that they can be, here you can find the coding conventions I have been following during the last 6 yeas of Ruby development.

## Contribute

The Rubyist is not a static project. It evolves day by day, collecting feedback from any team member and Ruby developer. Whenever we find a new common pattern and we feel it can reasonably become a convention or a good practice, we usually discuss it and formalize it here.

Feel free to suggest your own coding conventions.

## The Authors

This project is the work of [Simone Carletti](http://www.simonecarletti.com/) and several team mates that contributed by reviewing my proposals and reject those that were just bizarre personal fixations.
